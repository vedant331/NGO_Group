    <h3>Why Virtual Badges Matter</h3>
    <p style="max-width:800px; margin:auto;">
        Virtual badges serve as a recognition mechanism to motivate
        contributors and acknowledge their efforts. They promote
        long-term engagement without monetary incentives and help
        build a sense of community and purpose.
